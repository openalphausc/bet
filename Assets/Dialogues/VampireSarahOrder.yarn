	French 75. Quickly, if you will.

	Hello, you look eager, don’t you?. (Press SPACEBAR to continue)
	I’ll have a French 75. Silly name, good drink. I was in France in 75, you know. 1475, that is. Pour the gin. 
	After the gin add some syrup and zombie flesh.
<<endif>>
Haven’t changed my drink order in a century. Zombie flesh never gets old, does it?
